üìç Drop a pin, and get a complete risk intelligence breakdown for that area.

## Purpose 
To give ***investors***, ***businesses***, and ***institutions*** actionable location-based risk intelligence using map-based visualization and AI-assisted insights so they can invest, expand, or operate with data-backed confidence.


## The problem it solves 
Most market, financial, or infrastructure decisions are made based on broad data or intuition, not location-specific analysis. Tools like property websites or generic dashboards lack:
- Pin-point financial metrics (like credit risk or fraud exposure)
- Visual overlays of infrastructure health
- Instant contextual analysis on drop

### GeoFinRisk fills that gap by offering:
- Real-time map interaction
- Heatmap visualization
- AI-generated investment summaries
- Multi-metric analysis per location
