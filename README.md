üìç Drop a pin, and get a complete risk intelligence breakdown for that area.<br>


## Purpose 
To give ***investors***, ***businesses***, and ***institutions*** actionable location-based risk intelligence using map-based visualization and AI-assisted insights so they can invest, expand, or operate with data-backed confidence.<br><br>


## The problem it solves 
Most market, financial, or infrastructure decisions are made based on broad data or intuition, not location-specific analysis. Tools like property websites or generic dashboards lack:
- Pin-point financial metrics (like credit risk or fraud exposure)
- Visual overlays of infrastructure health
- Instant contextual analysis on drop

<br>
<br>
### GeoFinRisk fills that gap by offering:
- Real-time map interaction
- Heatmap visualization
- AI-generated investment summaries
- Multi-metric analysis per location

## Core Interaction: Drop a Marker ‚Üí ***Get Full Analysis***
When a user drops a pin on the map, the system performs localized analysis using synthetic data and displays:

Based on the local parameters you can determine various localised aspects as seen in the screenshot.

## Risk Layer Overlays (Heatmaps)
Each heatmap shows intensity per region based on synthetic financial data, helping you visually identify risk/opportunity zones.

### Available Layers:
- Credit Default Risk
- Property Market Trends
- Banking Infrastructure
- Fintech Activity Hub
- Fraud Risk Zones
- Economic Stability

## Use of Gmaps SDK 
GeoFinRisk is built using ***Google Maps JavaScript SDK***, enabling:
- Custom heatmap overlays `(google.maps.visualization.HeatmapLayer)`
- Real-time marker drops with event listeners `(google.maps.event.addListener)`
- Location-based queries and dynamic center positioning
- Smooth zoom/pan experience for geospatial analysis
- Interactive control layer for toggling heatmap visibility
  <br>
The SDK was essential in allowing seamless geospatial interaction, real-time marker analysis, and rendering complex heatmaps with performance and elegance.
